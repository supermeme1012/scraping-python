A web app to solve the new york times spelling bee.
## contributing
I greatly appreciate any and all contributions.  If you find words that do not belong, words that should be included or actually know something about a front end (unlike me obviously) please submit a pull request.  The vocab is being pulled from a file called `english_no_proper` which is a modified version of the linux english dictionary.  please format any word contributions as follows: \
one word per line \
all lowercase \
no special characters (convert characters like Ã¤ to a)
